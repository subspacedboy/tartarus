  <h2>Step 1</h2>
  <div>
    You need a key. It will work as your login and is required to do pretty much anything
    so make sure not to lose it ðŸ˜‡. You only need one no matter how many contracts you write or
    for any number of people. It's also important to <strong>not</strong> share it.
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/keypair']">Make a key</a>
  </div>
</div>


<h2>Step 1.5</h2>
<div class="row">
  Come back here to login with your key.
  <div class="row">
    You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/login']">Login</a>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<div>
  When you want to write a contract for someone they will send you a session link.
  Follow that link :-).
</div>
<!--<div>-->
<!--  <a [routerLink]="['/simple-contract']">Simple Contract (Offline only)</a>-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<div>-->
<!--  <a [routerLink]="['/full-contract']">Full Contract</a>-->
