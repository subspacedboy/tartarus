              You need a key. It will work as your login and is required to do pretty much anything
              so make sure not to lose it ðŸ˜‡. You only need one no matter how many contracts you write or
              for any number of people. It's also important to <strong>not</strong> share it.
            </div>

            <div>
              You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/keypair']">Make a key</a>
            </div>
          </div>


          <h2>Step 1.5</h2>
          <div>
            Come back here to login with your key.
            <div>
              You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/login']">Login</a>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Step 2</h2>

            When you want to write a contract for someone they will send you a session link.
            Follow that link :-).

          Your journey starts with the smart lock.
          When the lock starts up it will display a QR code that as a link in it.
          Follow that link. After you're logged in you'll be able to see it here in this spot.
