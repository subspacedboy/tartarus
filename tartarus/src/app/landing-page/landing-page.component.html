    <div>
      You need a key. It will work as your login and is required to do pretty much anything
      so make sure not to lose it ðŸ˜‡. You only need one no matter how many contracts you write or
      for any number of people. It's also important to <strong>not</strong> share it.

    <div class="row">
      You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/keypair']">Make a key</a>
    </div>
  </div>


  <h2>Step 1.5</h2>
  <div class="row">
    Come back here to login with your key.
    <div class="row">
      You can get one here: <a [routerLink]="['/login']">Login</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 2</h2>
  <div>
    When you want to write a contract for someone they will send you a session link.
    Follow that link :-).

    Your journey starts with the smart lock.
    When the lock starts up it will display a QR code that as a link in it.
    Follow that link. After you're logged in you'll be able to see it here in this spot.
