# Author Guide - So You Want To Hold Some Keys

## Step 1: Get A Keypair

Generate a keypair using the [key generator](https://tartarus.subjugated.club/keypair).
This keypair is how you login and what the software will use to sign all your contracts
and commands.

**Do not share it**. Especially with your sub. It's functionally a password. Anyone with this image/key file can release
or unlock a contract.

**Protect it**. Treat it like a physical key your sub handed you. If you lose it you'll need to find someone
to abort the contract.

## Step 2: Login

## Step 3: Get A Token From Your Sub

Every sub has two links. One is the "share" link the other is the "total control" link.
The "share" token starts with `s-` and the total control token starts with `tc-`.

An `s-` token will let you write a contract and send it to your sub for review and accept/reject.
A `tc-` token will let you write a contract and issue it directly. If the lock is online it will auto-accept it.
The website will let you know which you have.

When you load the link it will become a `KnownToken` and it will always be available on the website under "Lock sessions".
You can name the token so you can remember who it came from.

## Step 4: Write A Contract

Go nuts. Add bots. Whatever.

## Step 4: Enjoy

## Step 5: Release

When you're done you'll have a button for Release. That will end the contract.
