# Lock User Guide - So You Want Someone To Hold Your Keys

## Step 1: Complete Build + Setup

Make sure it's built, online, and working.

## Step 2: Login

Scan the QR code on the front of the lock.
It will give you a magical URL that will sign you into the website
as a `LockUserSession`.

## Step 3: Share Links

You'll see two links. One is your "Share" link and one is your "Total Control" link/token.
If you send someone the "Share" link and they write a contract you'll be given the option to accept/reject it.
If you send someone the "Total Control" link you will not be prompted, and the contract will be sent directly
to the hardware and accepted. You've been warned.

You can tell the tokens apart because share tokens start with `s-` and total control tokens start
with `tc-`.

## Step 4: Accept/Reject Contracts

Decide who you want to accept a contract from.

Make sure to read the terms. And especially note if any bots have been listed and with what permissions.

## Step 5: Wait For Release

Enjoy. If temporary unlocks are allowed you can go to the lock
screen on the lock and use the middle button to toggle the lock.
