# Building the Lock

## Bill of Materials

In order to build the lock you will need:

### Mandatory parts

* [Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather - 4MB Flash, 2MB PSRAM, STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691). If you want an "official" build + badge on the coordinator, you'll need to order one from subjugated.club. Homebrew versions are totally welcome and don't limit your features.
* [STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-Pin Cable - 50mm Long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399)
* [Tiny Code Reader from Useful Sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5744)
* [Micro servo - TowerPro SG92R](https://www.adafruit.com/product/169) - You can also use any generic SG90/SG92 form factor servo.
* [7x Socket Head Cap Screw: M2-0.4 Thread Size, 8 mm Lg, Std, Black Oxide, Steel, Class 12.9, 100 PK](https://www.grainger.com/product/6CE33)
* [7x Hex Nut: M2-0.40 Thread, 4 mm Hex Wd, 1.6 mm Hex Ht, Steel, Class 8, Zinc Plated, 100 PK](https://www.grainger.com/product/26KR83)
* Adhesive. Hot glue if you want some margin of error, superglue if you want a more "secure" experience.

### Optional, but good to have

* [Loctite Threadlocker Blue](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/products/central-pdp.html/loctite-threadlocker-blue/SAP_0201OHL029W4.html)

### Tools

* Soldering iron
* Technical screwdriver

## 3D Files

You can get the full kit of parts here: [Full kit](../static/tartarus_parts.3mf)

I personally use Prusa slicer + the Prusa MINI+ for most builds. I use organic supports, 15% infill, and the 0.20mm SPEED profile.
Feel free to adjust as necessary. I recommend printing with PLA.
